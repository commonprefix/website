		<meta name="description" content="Axelar is the leading interoperability solution for moving assets and arbitrary messages from one blockchain to another. A pioneer in the bridging of assets, they were the first in the field to implement a broadly deployed bridge that does not rely on a fixed committee or federation, unlike typical multisig bridges.  Instead, they rely only on their underlying proof-of-stake security assumptions, by leveraging their population of Cosmos validators.  Axelar’s architecture is distinguished by its permissionless proof-of-stake network and hub-and-spoke model, which enables firewalling between connected chains and limits systemic risk in the event of individual chain failures. Among interoperability protocols, Axelar uniquely combines a fully decentralized validator set with real economic value secured on-chain.  Common Prefix has worked closely with Axelar since 2021, beginning before the launch of its public network. Over the years, this collaboration deepened from early security audits of Axelar’s Gateway smart contracts to becoming a core technical contributor to the ecosystem, including the development of complex cross-chain integrations such as the Axelar Amplifier integration with Ripple&amp;#39;s XRP Ledger. In late 2025, Common Prefix assumed the lead stewardship role for the Axelar Network, taking responsibility for its technology direction, product evolution, and long-term vision.

				<p>Common Prefix has partnered with Axelar to integrate Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL) with Axelar's Amplifier interoperability infrastructure. This integration enables bridging assets between XRPL and all Axelar-supported chains. It also allows smart contracts on on other chains to be called directly from XRPL.</p>
